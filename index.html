            <p class="para">The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared universe centered 
              on a series of superhero films, independently produced by Marvel Studios and based on characters that 
              appear in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The franchise also includes comic books, 
              short films, television series, and digital series. The shared universe, much like the original Marvel 
              Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. 
              Phil Coulson, portrayed by Clark Gregg, is an original character to the MCU and the only character to appear across
              all its different media.</p>

                The initials "DC" came from the company's popular series Detective Comics, which featured Batman's debut and
                subsequently became part of the company's name. Originally in Manhattan at 432 Fourth Avenue, the DC 
                Comics offices have been located at 480 and later 575 Lexington Avenue; 909 Third Avenue; 75 Rockefeller 
                Plaza; 666 Fifth Avenue; and 1325 Avenue of the Americas. DC had its headquarters at 1700 Broadway, Midtown
                Manhattan, New York City, however DC Entertainment relocated its headquarters from New York to Burbank, 
                California in April of 2015.

                The Flash (or simply Flash) is the name of several superheroes appearing in American comic books published 
                by DC Comics. Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert, the original Flash first appeared in 
                Flash Comics #1 (cover date January 1940/release month November 1939). Nicknamed the "Scarlet Speedster",
                all incarnations of the Flash possess "super speed", which includes the ability to run, move, and think 
                extremely fast, use superhuman reflexes, and seemingly violate certain laws of physics.

              <h2>Green Arrow</h2>
              <img src="img/arrow.jpg">
              <p>
                Green Arrow is a fictional superhero who appears in comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Mort Weisinger
                and designed by George Papp, he first appeared in More Fun Comics #73 in November 1941. His real name is Oliver 
                Jonas Queen, a wealthy businessman and owner of Queen Industries who is also a well-known celebrity in Star City.
                Sometimes shown dressed like the character Robin Hood, Green Arrow is an archer who uses his skills to fight
                crime in his home cities of Star City and Seattle, as well as alongside his fellow superheroes as a member of 
                the Justice League. Though much less frequently used in modern stories, he also deploys a range of trick arrows
                with various special functions, such as glue, explosive-tipped, grappling hook, flash grenade, tear gas and even 
                kryptonite arrows for use in a range of special situations. At the time of his debut, Green Arrow functioned in 
                many ways as an archery-themed analogue of the very popular Batman character, but writers at DC subsequently 
                developed him into a voice of left-wing politics very much distinct in character from Batman.

                  Achilles, and Mercury), can transform himself into a costumed adult with the powers of superhuman strength, speed,
                  flight and other abilities. The character battles an extensive rogues' gallery, primarily archenemies Dr. Sivana, 
                  Black Adam, and Mister Mind.
